### Publishing
Every changes pushed to master branch will trigger a new release and auto-publish to maven central. 

For a manuel publish, first you need to populate a gradle.properties file. (note that this file is ignored by git, please DO NOT push it).

```$xslt
# sample gradle.properties file
version=<VERSION_TO_PUBLISH>
signing.keyId=<GPG_KEY_SHORT_ID>
signing.password=<GPG_KEY_PASSWORD>
signing.secretKeyRingFile=<PATH_TO_YOUR_GPG_SECRET_KEY>
nexusUsername=<YOUR_SONATYPE_USERNAME>
nexusPassword=<YOUR_SONATYPE_PASSWORD>
```
After you created gradle.properties file, run the following commands:

```$xslt
# simple clean and build
./gradlew clean
./gradlew build

# sign and upload artifacts to
# sonatype staging repo: https://oss.sonatype.org
./gradlew uploadArchives

# close and release the new version of library
# it will be available in ~10m in Maven Central Repo: http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/opuscapita/peppol/peppol-models/
# and it will be available in ~2h in Maven Central Search: https://search.maven.org/
./gradlew closeAndReleaseRepository
```
If you want to test your changes locally, you can publish to your local repository and depend it from your service. To publish to your local maven repository (`~/m2`) execute:
```
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
```


### Versioning
The version number has 3 parts: `[major].[minor].[patch]`. 

The major and minor version numbers are being fetched from the [VERSION](VERSION) file. If you want to release a new major or minor version, edit the VERSION file and push it to master.

The patch version number is auto generated using git tags. Every release from master tagged with the version number which has 1 more patch number from the previous one.
